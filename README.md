# Project_2
Famous Operas App due 10/29/20 at 9:00 am

Technologies used:
I used mongodb, mongoose, Node.js, ejs and express as major technologies. The project
adheres to the MVC structure which includes Models, Views and Controllers.
There is a model with all 7 RESTful routs and full CRUD. I used Github to commit
periodically the working on the project. The project is deployed online and
accessible to the public via Heroku.

Approach taken:
The project was designed the way that a user can add a new opera to the list
of existing operas. When a new opera is created, there is a link to a website
about this new opera. When a user wants to change something in the entry, the App
allows edit the existing entry.

Unsolved problems:
the project seems to be working and the routes re-directing the way they are
supposed to.

Notes to myself
